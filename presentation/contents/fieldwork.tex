\section{Fieldwork} %Simulation and results

\subsection{Model simulation}

\begin{frame}{Model simulation}
	In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, a number of experiments are executed to measure their performance:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item \alert{Internal Chinese student mobility program?} (students moving
to another chinese university during one academic year)
    \item Digital marketing: attract Chinese universities in order to
participante in experiments
    \item Involving \textbf{IROs} (International Relations Offices) officers and
IT staff into the use of experimental software applications â†’
acceptability issue?
	\item But quite hard to arrange! Better using some \alert{model simulation} techniques (stochastical
processes)

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
