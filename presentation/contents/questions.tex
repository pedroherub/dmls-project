\begin{frame}{Mechanism design: multifactor}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Based on three parameters:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item \alert{Workers' bidding}
            \item \alert{Reputation}
            \item \alert{Recent data quality estimation}
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework \rightarrow (top-down)
    	\begin{enumerate}
            \item \alert{Objective level}: winning workers
            \item \alert{Criteria level}: parameters criteria
            \item \alert{Alternative level}: workers available
          \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{exampleblock}{Multifactor worker evaluation approach}
    	\begin{equation*}
      	\theta_{i}=\omega_{1} B_{i}+\omega_{2} R_{i}+\omega_{3} Q_{i} \quad\quad \text { where } \omega_{i} \geq 0 \text { and } \sum_{\omega_{i}=1}^{3} \omega_{i}=1

\subsection{Mechanism design: issues}

\begin{frame}{Mechanism design: issues}
  		\begin{enumerate}
   			\item \textbf{How to select appropriate workers?}
   				\begin{itemize}
   					\item \textbf{Proposal: } decentralized architecture (blockchain technology) that lacks a single point of failure, and enhances privacy with asymmetric encryption and digital signature technology
   				\end{itemize}
    		\item \textbf{How to distribute the rewards to the workers?}
  		\end{enumerate}
  		With the help of \alert{mechanism design theory}\cite{article56} two important properties for the incentive mechanism are guaranteed:
  		\begin{itemize}
   					\item \textbf{Incentive quality (IC):} the truthful submission of sensing  cost is the worker's optimal bidding strategy
   					\item \textbf{Individual rationality (IR):} the reward must compensate for the worker's cost (non-negative)
   		\end{itemize}
