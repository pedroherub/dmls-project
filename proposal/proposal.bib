abstract = {To improve real-world applications of machine learning, experienced modelers develop intuition about their datasets, their models, and how the two interact. Manual inspection of raw data - of representative samples, of outliers, of misclassifications - is an essential tool in a) identifying and fixing problems in the data, b) generating new modeling hypotheses, and c) assigning or refining human-provided labels. However, manual data inspection is problematic for privacy sensitive datasets, such as those representing the behavior of real-world individuals. Furthermore, manual data inspection is impossible in the increasingly important setting of federated learning, where raw examples are stored at the edge and the modeler may only access aggregated outputs such as metrics or model parameters. This paper demonstrates that generative models - trained using federated methods and with formal differential privacy guarantees - can be used effectively to debug many commonly occurring data issues even when the data cannot be directly inspected. We explore these methods in applications to text with differentially private federated RNNs and to images using a novel algorithm for differentially private federated GANs.}

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g. mobile devices or
whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server (e.g. service
provider), while keeping the training data decentralized. FL embodies the principles of focused data
collection and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks and costs resulting
from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches. Motivated by the explosive
growth in FL research, this paper discusses recent advances and presents an extensive collection of open
problems and challenges.}

abstract = {With the technological advances in machine learning, effective ways are available to process the huge amount
of data generated in real life. However, issues of privacy and
scalability will constrain the development of machine learning.
Federated learning (FL) can prevent privacy leakage by assigning
training tasks to multiple clients, thus separating the central
server from the local devices. However, FL still suffers from
shortcomings such as single-point-failure and malicious data. The
emergence of blockchain provides a secure and efficient solution
for the deployment of FL. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the literature on blockchained FL (BCFL).
First, we investigate how blockchain can be applied to federal
learning from the perspective of system composition. Then, we
analyze the concrete functions of BCFL from the perspective
of mechanism design and illustrate what problems blockchain
addresses specifically for FL. We also survey the applications of
BCFL in reality. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future
research directions.

abstract = {The role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the revolutionized society cannot be overlooked. The IoT can leverage advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for its applications. However, given the fact of massive data, which is stored at a central cloud server, adopting centralized machine learning algorithms is not a viable option due to immense computation cost and privacy leakage issues. Given such conditions, blockchain can be leveraged to enhance the privacy of IoT networks by making them decentralized without any central authority. Nevertheless, the sensitive and massive data that is stored in distributive fashion, leveraged it for application purpose, is still a challenging task. To overcome this challenging task, federated learning (FL), which is a new breed of ML is the most promising solution that brings learning to the end devices without sharing the private data to the central server. In the FL mechanism, the central server act as an orchestrator to start the FL learning process, and only model parameters' updates are shared between end devices and the central orchestrator. Although FL can provide better privacy and data management, it is still in the development phase and has not been adopted by various communities due to its unknown privacy issues. In this paper first, we present the notion of blockchain and its application in IoT systems. Then we describe the privacy issues related to the implementation of blockchain in IoT and present privacy preservation techniques to cope with the privacy issues. Second, we introduce the FL application in IoT systems, devise a taxonomy, and present privacy threats in FL. Afterward, we present IoT-based use cases on envisioned dispersed federated learning and introduce blockchain-based traceability functions to improve privacy. Finally, open research gaps are addressed for future work.}

ABSTRACT = {The fast proliferation of edge computing devices brings an increasing growth of data, which directly promotes machine learning (ML) technology development. However, privacy issues during data collection for ML tasks raise extensive concerns. To solve this issue, synchronous federated learning (FL) is proposed, which enables the central servers and end devices to maintain the same ML models by only exchanging model parameters. However, the diversity of computing power and data sizes leads to a significant difference in local training data consumption, and thereby causes the inefficiency of FL. Besides, the centralized processing of FL is vulnerable to single-point failure and poisoning attacks. Motivated by this, we propose an innovative method, federated learning with asynchronous convergence (FedAC) considering a staleness coefficient, while using a blockchain network instead of the classic central server to aggregate the global model. It avoids real-world issues such as interruption by abnormal local device training failure, dedicated attacks, etc. By comparing with the baseline models, we implement the proposed method on a real-world dataset, MNIST, and achieve accuracy rates of 98.96% and 95.84% in both horizontal and vertical FL modes, respectively. Extensive evaluation results show that FedAC outperforms most existing models.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowdsensing is an emerging paradigm of data aggregation, which has a pivotal role in data-driven applications. By leveraging the recruitment, a crowdsensing system collects a large amount of data from mobile devices at a low cost. The critical issues in the development of crowdsensing are platform security, privacy protection, and incentive. However, the existing centralized, platform-based approaches suffer from the single point of failure which may result in data leakage. Besides, few previous studies have addressed the considerations of both the economic incentive and data quality. In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing architecture based on blockchain technology which will help improve the attack resistance. Furthermore, we present a hybrid incentive mechanism, which integrates the data quality, reputation, and monetary factors to encourage participants to contribute their sensing data while discouraging malicious behaviors. The effectiveness our of proposed incentive model is verified through a combination of the theory of mechanism design. The performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed hybrid incentive model is a reliable and efficient mean to promote data security and incentivizing positive conduct on the crowdsensing application.},
